Net::Google::PicasaWeb is a set of perl modules providing an Object Orientated binding to the Google Picasa Web Albums Data APIs, allowing you to retrieve information about albums and photos in a Picasaweb account, and to manage (create, delete and upload) albums and photos.

Work on this codebase is (unfortunately) stalled - it is unlikely that I will get any reasonable time to look at this any time soon.

If you're interested in taking this over, then please contact me.

Regards,
Rob.
